## Python Script Manager GUI

This small tool is meant to register and run one off python scripts 

I'm sure there are better options out there ([Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) and [PyAutoGui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/) come to mind) , but I'm not a python developer, on that note, this was mostly generated using ChatGPT.

It uses PyInstaller, Python, Tk and SqlLite
